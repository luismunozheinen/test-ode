# test-ode
Simplified project to evaluate the efficiency of the differential equation solver

**test_ode.jl** contains the main code to run for the setup and simulation whereas **test_functions.jl** contains all functions required to setup the differential equation system `f`. Use `show(f)` to visualise the system. 

The files **ic.jld2** and **parameter.jld2** contain the initial conditions `u0` and input parameters `p` respectively.
